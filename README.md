This is my first flutter project.

I am testing around and learning the basics of flutter and by doing so and following a codelab I built this random name generator app.

The app can generate a limited combination of words from an imported dictionary library that randomly connects them.
You can also like a word, which will be stored in a seperate page where you can see the number of favorite words you added and which ones these ones are.
